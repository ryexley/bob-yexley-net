These are the tools that I typically prefer to use for my work. This page will always be a work in progress.

- **My editor of choice**: [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - I love Sublime. It's just so fast and light and non-resource-intensive. I also use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) sometimes as well, which has a _much_ broader set of extension options, but has been flaky for me on occasion, and has a tendency to be a bit slower (though it performs pretty well for a large, complex [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) app).
- **My language of choice**: Currently [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) is my language of choice, though I typically try to live by the "use the best language for the job" mantra. Just so happens that the vast majority of my work over the past several years has been focused largely around web browser based applications and the APIs that they consume, and if you're familiar with that environment at all, then I don't need to tell you that it just makes sense that JavaScript is right in the middle of all of that. I'm interested in branching out and learning a few other languages like [Go](https://golang.org/) and [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/).
