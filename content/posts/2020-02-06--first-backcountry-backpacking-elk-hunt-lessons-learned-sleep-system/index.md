_This is the fourth post in a series on lessons I learned on my first backcountry backpacking elk hunt. [The previous post, which focused on tents, can be found here](/first-backcountry-backpacking-elk-hunt-lessons-learned-tents)._

I am a side/stomach sleeper. Always have been, and I don't see that fact changing anytime soon. At some point, that decision is subconscious and happens in your sleep, so you have very little control over changing it.

But it's this very reason that has always made it a challenge for me to sleep effectively when camping. I've slept in my share of mummy bags, and it's never resulted in a good night's sleep for me. I just simply can't get comfortable in them with the way my subconscious is used to trying to position my body when I sleep.

So I put a lot of time and energy into researching sleep systems in preparation for this trip, and based on the result, I'm really glad that I did.
